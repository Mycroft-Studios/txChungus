:warning: **txAdmin is working properly, but `idms.fivem.net` may be having issues.**
:warning: Every single admin has a backup password, you can login using that instead of the CitizenFX button!

**:lock: If you own the server and forgot your password:**
        - Use <https://bcrypt-generator.com/> to generate a new password hash;
        - Open `txData/admins.json`, replace the hash for the user and save the file;
        - Wait 15 seconds and try to login.

**:rocket: If you are creating a new server and don't have a master account:**
        - Create a `txData/admins.json` file with this content  <https://gist.github.com/tabarra/6c8c168a275f20e4b774c7e33ffd8dbf>;
        - Start txAdmin;
        - Login with the username `txmaster` and password `masterpassword123`;
        - Change this password!
