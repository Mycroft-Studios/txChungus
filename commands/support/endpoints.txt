:point_right: Solution for the `No endpoint_add_* found` error:
:one: open your `server.cfg` 
:two: remove all `endpoint_add_*` lines
:three: add this to the start of the file:
```
endpoint_add_tcp "0.0.0.0:30120"
endpoint_add_udp "0.0.0.0:30120"
```
You can change the port as you like but do **not** change the 0.0.0.0
