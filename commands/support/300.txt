:warning: Make sure you do not have `stop monitor` in any of your cfg files, or txAdmin would not be able to detect that the server started.
:hourglass: If that's not the case, then your server is taking more than 5 minutes to load, and you for sure:
a) Have way too many resources. You know all those oversized asset warnings? yeah that's a thing.
b) Have some slow-loading resources like chocohax.
c) Have a slow CPU or storage.
There is no way to disable this restart, you NEED to FIX YOUR SERVER.
